High in the queue. [The OpenTracing specification](http://opentracing.io/spec/) is pan-platform and translations to new languages typically takes a few weeks from an initial commit to something usable. Check in with [the OpenTracing community on Gitter](https://gitter.im/opentracing/public) for a more specific timeline or to get involved.
